- Increment Game (increment_game_gui.py)

Creates clicker-style game with a shop and interactive menu.
Will eventually create save system, as well as GUI.

- Password Generator (pass_gen_gui.py)

Creates a random password based on the length and if the user wants to include special characters.
Includes entry box for specific terms being added to the password's start or end.
Almost entirely bugfixed; needs read system (write system already implemented).

- Password Manager (pass_manager_gui.py)

Planning to use MySQL to securely store user-generated passwords into a database. May also use Windows authentication (local user) for additional security. If Windows authentication is not used, encryption shall be used in lieu of it.
